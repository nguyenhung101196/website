                We know you love Chicago as much as we do. 
                Especially since we decided to put our store, Wrightwood Furniture,
                in the heart of Lakeview. The only hard thing about making your home in
                Chicago is buying and getting new furniture home. You probably know that 
                we’ve got you covered on making furniture buying simple, but did you know 
                we also make getting it home easy too? At Wrightwood, we care about our 
                furniture, not just when it’s in our store, but also when it gets to your home.
                Because of this, we have many different furniture delivery and pick up options
                for you to choose from. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Want to pick up your in store or online purchase from our Lakeview furniture store?
                 No problem! Simply choose “in store pick-up” after you have placed your order and 
                 you can pick up in our store at 3036 N. Lincoln on Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. 
                 to 6 p.m. Your brand new furniture piece will be ready to pick up from our store 
                 the same or next day from when you order it. There is a free 15-minute loading zone 
                 just south of the store that you can use to pick up your furniture. However, we
                 definitely encourage you to bring some blankets to protect your brand new furniture.
                 And in store pick-up is free of charge with any sized order!
            </p>

                But what if you’re like most of us city dwellers and don’t own a car? No worries!
                We’ve got a furniture delivery option that we like to call our “white glove” service.
                Unlike normal home delivery services, ours involves your new furniture being brought
                to you fully assembled and carefully wrapped in furniture blankets. Your new piece
                will be placed in the room you choose so you don’t have to worry about navigating
                it through difficult doors or up stairs by yourself. And we won’t leave behind any
                packing materials either! Simply choose delivery when you check out on our online 
                store and our “white glove” home delivery service will call to schedule a time 
                that is convenient for you. Same day delivery options available upon request.     
            </p>
