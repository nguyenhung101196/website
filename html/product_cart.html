                        A piece that is meant for storage does not have to take away 
                        from your living space. We fell for this piece as soon as we 
                        saw it. Part of the Amazing India collection, our 8 drawer 
                        console in natural limewash is great for holding items and 
                        also brings a touch of sophistication to the space it is in. 
                        Not only does our Amazing India collection consist of great, 
                        distinctive pieces but the factory that crafts these pieces 
                        practices sustainability. This console is made from the wood of 
                        a mango tree that no longer produces fruit and the factory 
                        replaces the trees that they have used for making their furniture. 
                        Fall in love with this piece and take a look at the many other 
                        one of a kind items from the Amazing India collection today at 
                        Wrightwood Furniture!
