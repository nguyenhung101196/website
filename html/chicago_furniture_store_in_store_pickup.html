                 When you check out, simply select in-store pickup as your delivery option. After you 
                 have placed your order, you can pick up from our Lakeview Chicago furniture store at 
                 3036 N. Lincoln. You can come by any time we’re open, which is Tuesday through Sunday 
                 10am to 6pm. However, on Monday we are closed.

                There is a free 15-minute loading zone just a few steps south of the store that you can 
                use when you pick up your furniture. We encourage you to bring some blankets to protect 
                your furniture and your car. Your brand nwq furniture pieace will be ready to pick up from
                our Lakeview furniture store the same or next day from when you order it.
