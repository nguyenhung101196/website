                The Wrightwood environmental commitment is unique to the industry 
                because our whole way of doing business is unique to the industry. 
                We ship furniture directly from the factory to the store. No warehouses. 
                Minimal packaging. Quality recycled materials. We’re changing the way 
                furniture is bought and sold, and the Earth is a better place for it.

               What Is Eco Friendly Furniture?
            </p>
            <p>
               There’s a reason eco friendly, recycled, and sustainable are trendy 
               words in the business these days.
            </p>
            <p>
               People care about the environment, and we care about those people. 
               When you’re purchasing eco friendly furniture, these are the words 
               you need to look for, so remember to keep an eye out.
            </p>
            <p>
               Pieces crafted from sustainably-harvested woods are always a safe bet, 
               along with eco friendly furniture made from reclaimed wood.
            </p>
            <p>
               Next question: What is reclaimed wood? So glad you asked. Reclaimed wood 
               is wood that was once used for a different purpose, meaning it it has a 
               past life that has more to it than just living on a tree. Most reclaimed 
               wood is taken from old furniture, old houses, factory scraps, or flawed 
               wood—but that’s what makes the pieces one-of-a-kind.  
            </p>

                <b>Recycled Materials</b>
            </p>
            <p>
               Eco Friendly furniture begins with materials and construction. All of our 
               woods are either recycled or plantation-grown (as opposed to sourced from 
               rainforests or old-growth forests). Our aluminum, too, is recycled.
            </p>
            <p>
               We visited the Indian city of Moradabad, which specializes in metal work, 
               to find the perfect factory. We found it. Rather than dabbling in many 
               different metals, our factory exclusively works with recycled aluminum. 
               You’ll find ottomans from Jaipur made with recycled cotton or recycled wool.
            </p>
            <p>
               We even have pillows sewn from recycled saris. Those are the beautiful, 
               bright Indian dresses you may have seen in your favorite Bollywood musical.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:1.7em; color:black;">
                <b>Resilient Furniture</b>
            </p>
            <p>
               We wouldn’t bother with repurposed materials if they were going to end 
               up in a landfill anyway. Skilled artisans build our sustainable furniture 
               to last. You won’t find cam locks or a box full of parts and a Swedish 
               assembly guide. Almost everything is fully assembled and ready to use for 
               years and years.
            </p>

                <b>Reducing Our Carbon Footprint</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Think the big chains and retailers are efficient? They’re not. We do a lot 
                more with a lot less. We ship directly from factory to store, eliminating 
                the middlemen. We don’t have warehouses. Our packaging is minimal. It’s just 
                the opposite for the big chains: more shipments, more middlemen, more warehouses, 
                and more packaging. That’s not just environmentally irresponsible. It’s expensive. 
                By using less, we do more for the environment and deliver even greater value to you.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:1.7em; color:black;">
                <b>Responsible, Local Service</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We currently serve Chicagoland (Chicago+suburbs), because that keeps logistics 
                simple. We can serve our customers best when they’re close to us. We ship all 
                our furniture directly from the factories to our store. You can then either pick 
                up your new sustainable furniture at our Lakeview  store or receive it the same 
                day you place your order.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:1.7em; color:black;">
                <b>So there you have it</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                For every business decision, we make the one that is most eco-friendly. That 
                guiding principle always benefits our customers, too.
