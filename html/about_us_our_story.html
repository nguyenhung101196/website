            <p>
                Hello. Welcome to Wrightwood Furniture. So glad you’re here. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re Doug &amp; Mike, the father-son founders of Wrightwood.
                We’ve been working in the furniture industry for pretty much
                our entire lives. We used to be in the wholesale business,
                but now we’re designing, sourcing, and buying unique furniture 
                from around the world and selling it directly to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The big chains used to be our clients. Now they’re our competitors. 
                And we’ve learned a few things about them over the years. For example, 
                the big chains don’t charge high prices because they want lots of money. 
                Or at least that’s not the only reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nope.
            </p>
            <p>
               They do it because they are inefficient. Furniture is different from other 
               stuff we buy. It’s big. It’s bulky. Handling furniture is expensive. We saw 
               our clients driving our modern furniture in circles. Storing it in warehouses. 
               Picking it up and driving it again. These companies are essentially furniture 
               chauffeurs. And chauffeurs are expensive. Like 30-50 percent of the cost of product expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                So we’re doing something different with Wrightwood. We ship direct to our store. 
                Without middlemen (learn more about our approach in this blog post).
            </p>
            <p>
                We ship from our favorite factories directly to our store in Chicago, and that 
                alone brings down prices by 40 percent. That’s good for you. It’s also good for 
                the environment. Our eco friendly furniture is responsibly sourced so you can 
                feel good about the sustainable furniture you purchase from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                And unlike the big, inefficient retailers, we find some really cool, eco 
                friendly furniture. No mass-produced, assembly required, only available in 
                brown junk. We’re talking fun colors. Industrial and rustic furniture. 
                One-of-a-kind designs. Expert craftsmanship. Distinctive finishes. It’s 
                modern furniture that speaks to us. It might speak to you, too.
